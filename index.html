      <p class="story-text">
        Tolu was no tech wizard—not yet. By day, he worked as a client agent at a bustling study abroad agency, helping hopeful students chase dreams across continents. He booked appointments, answered endless emails, and patiently walked anxious parents through visa procedures. He was good at it. But deep down, he craved something more—something he could build with his own hands, something that would outlast a phone call or a stamp on a passport.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        That craving brought him to the PLP Software Engineering course.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        Every evening, once the office lights dimmed and the buzz of student inquiries faded, Tolu transformed into a learner. He’d pull out his modest laptop, open up his lessons, and dive into a world that was still foreign to him—variables, loops, syntax errors, Git. At first, it felt like learning a new language with no translator. But there was fire in his belly.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        He wasn't just learning to code; he was laying the bricks for a future he could shape on his own terms.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        Tolu dreamed of one day building digital platforms that made education more accessible—perhaps even an app that streamlined study abroad processes for students in underrepresented communities. He imagined a world where people didn’t have to wait in long queues or feel overwhelmed by paperwork. Tech, he believed, could simplify lives, open doors, and close gaps.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        Balancing work with the PLP course wasn’t easy. He'd return home exhausted, only to spend hours debugging a stubborn Python function. His friends stopped asking him out midweek—Tolu was always “studying.” Sometimes he questioned himself. Was this really worth it?
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        But then he’d remember the way his heart raced the first time he saw “Hello, World!” printed on his screen. The way each small win felt like a leap. The vision that kept him wide-eyed at 2 a.m.—not of foreign universities, but of a world he could help code into something better.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        He wasn’t just chasing another job. Tolu was chasing impact.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        And though the journey was long, and the nights even longer, he knew this: his story had only just begun—between visa applications and variables, between clients and code.
      </p>
      <p class="story-text">
        He wasn’t just crossing borders anymore. He was building bridges. Building with the assurance that, in a little while, crossing to the other side would be assured. He was coding his way to a future that was not just his, but for everyone who dared to dream beyond borders and bugs.
